# Fuzzy-Matching
This script contains a function generate_synthetic_data that generates synthetic data based on specified column types using the Faker library.

This repository contains Python scripts for generating synthetic data and performing fuzzy matching of the generated data against a reference dataset.
The scripts use the Faker library to generate synthetic data and `thefuzz` library to calculate similarity scores for fuzzy matching.
